### Getting started
The project has been primarily built for the universal Windows platform (UWP), so you'll need the latest version of [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (including the community edition) and the latest Windows 10 SDK which you can install as part of the Visual Studio installer.
